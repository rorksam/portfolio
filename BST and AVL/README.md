This is the Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree package, described in main's README.md file.

There are certain algorithms here (especially the iterators) that have more efficient code online, however as this was code for an educational project, I wanted to do as much as I could with my own logic, so I had slightly different algorithms. Still efficient, just not peak.

The main methods in both classes can be ignored, as it just helped me test the functionality of the logic systems.
