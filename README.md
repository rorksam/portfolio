A collection of important projects and programs

# detail
Below are a list of all the different programs you'll find in this file, how to run them, and their contact in my classes.

# list
1. San Francisco project
   This is a basic java package that takes the data found SF_restaurant_scores_full.csv, parses it, creates a list of these restaurants, and makes it searchable by zip code and name.
   You can run this in any java code compiler.
   This project was for Professor John Ortega's CSC017 class at Hofstra University.
2. BST/AVL
   Another basic java package, this time creating a generic list class based on the Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree formats. Any data type that implements Comparable can use these list classes.
   You can run this in any java code compiler.
   This project was for Professor John Ortega's CSC017 class at Hofstra University.
3. Traffic Light Project
   This project was made in Xilinx ISE Design suite, and is designed to run on the NexysA7 FPGA board. It simulates a traffic light system for a highway that has an intersection with a less busy farm road.
   The file TrafficLightReport has more information about how this runs, what it does, and the design behind it.
   This was a group project.
   You can run this on any NexysA7 board, using Adept to download the program onto it.
   This was a project for Professor Wing Kwong's ENGG032b class at Hofstra University.
4. Temperature-Song Project
   This project was made on MGTEK MiniIDE, using assembly to program the Dragon12 Plus board to play different songs on the buzzer, based on the temperature read out by the U14 Temperature sensor.
   This can be ran on any Dragon12 board.
   This was a project for Professor Wing Kwong's ENGG036 class, Microprocessor Systems, at Hofstra University
