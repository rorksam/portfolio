This is the Traffic Light Project, created with Dan Elhamawaly and Mirsan Padilla. For more information on this project, check TrafficLightReport.pdf and the main's README.md file.
The main files of interest here are state_machine.vhd, top.sch, and top.ucf, although TrafficLightReport.pdf specifies the work well.
